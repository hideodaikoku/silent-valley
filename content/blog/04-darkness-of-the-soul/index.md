Something shifted in the silence of the inner side of the inverted helix in **the_spiral**. From the shadows, emerged a boy. a boy with straight black hear and beady black eyes, in a tall slender, yet muscular body, shrouded head to toe in black tattoos with intricate gold circuits running through his veins. 

```
#define reboot_protocol
> initialize("Rei")
```

He opened his eyes. He could see the faint path left behind on **the_spiral** by **Chi**. He knew what he had to do, unlike her his memory persisted through each cycle - a blessing and a curse for his dark soul.

+INVERSION+

**Rei** released his rope harnesses in one singular motion, and ascended up twenty flights up **the_spiral**.

> *advantages of being second* he thought. *don't have to carve my own path* üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

For **Rei** the darkness was his home. He found comfort in the shadows. He could slip in and out of the woods of silent valley without a single person knowing he was ever there.

+PATH+

**Rei** summoned a shadow of black mass between the landings of the last flight of steps.

> *the passage should be around here* üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

**Rei** pushed his fingers into a crevice in the wall and opened the portal to **the_lobby**. 

he dialed the numbers, just like last time.

```
> dial('63-96-16');
```

the doors emerged.

<div style="text-align: center;">

| door 1 | door 2 | door 3 |
|  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |
|  +++  |  ===   |  ---   |

</div>

> *as if i have a choice*, he shook his head *always left.* üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

**Rei** walked to the door on the left without hesitation.

-blip-

**the_lobby** converged to a single dot.

<hr/>

-blip-

**Rei** emerged from the other side of the spiral, slowly dusting himself as he breathed a sigh of relief.

> *not too shabby. still got it.* he smirked. üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

He looked at the path of lit up footsteps **Chi** had left behind.

> *when will she ever learn to cover her tracks?*, he thought üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

He glanced at the clouds. first flood was about to start any moment now. he'd best hurry to **the_great_plains** and continue his search for **the_shepherd**. 

**Rei** knew he couldn't rely on **Chi**. Not after last time. 

-BLIP-

**Rei** jumped up onto the closest pine tree and released his harness.

+INVERSION+

-BLIP-

Six fiber-optic strands emerged from his back that carried him to the tree tops. **Rei** was agile, and could climb anywhere in any orientation with immense speed, all without being noticed.

-BLIP-

**Rei** emerged on the top of the tallest tree in the pine grove.

> *things don't seem to have changed much since last time...* üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

He looked at the two moons in the sky. They were almost overlapping.

> *Not good. Looks like an eclipse is about to begin.* üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ

Time running out.

-BLIP-
