something shifted in the silence of the inner side of the inverted helix in **the_spiral**. as light casts its rays, shadows too, must cast themselves into existence. 

From the echoes of **the_spirit**'s footsteps emerged a boy. a boy with straight black hear and beady black eyes, in a tall slender, et muscular body covered in a black battle-ready overall. 

```

```

> *strange*...*100 years*

He could see the faint path left behind on **the_spiral** by *CHI*. He knew what he had to do, unlike her his memory persisted through each cycle - a blessing and a curse for his dark soul.

+INVERSION+

**REI** released his rope harnesses in one singular motion, and ascended up twenty flights up **the_spiral**.

> *advantages of being second*, he thought. *I don't have to carve my own path*

For **REI** the darkness was his home. He found comfort in the shadows. He could slip in and out of the woods of silent valley without a single person knowing he was ever there.

+BOLT+

**REI** summoned a bolt of black lightning between the landings and walked on it effortlessly. After all, he was a hundred year old divine entity trapped in the body of a teenage boy - walking on lightning was nothing new.

> *the passage should be around here*

**REI** pushed his fingers into a crevice in the wall and opened the portal to **the_lobby**. 

he dialed the numbers

```
> dial('63-96-66');
```

the doors emerged.

<div style="text-align: center;">

| door 1 | door 2 | door 3 |

</div>

> *as if i have a choice*, he shook his head *always left.*

*REI* walked to the door on the left without hesitation.

> *amor fati*

-blip-

then there was nothing.

<hr/>

-blip-

*REI* emerged from the other side of the spiral, slowly dusting himself as he breathed a sigh of relief.

> *not too shabby. still got it.* he smirked.

He looked at the path of lit up footsteps **Chi** had left behind.

> *when will she ever learn to cover her tracks?*, he thought

He glanced at the clouds. first flood was about to start any moment now. he'd best hurry to **the_great_plains** and continue his search for **the_shepherd**. 

**REI** knew he couldn't rely on **Chi**. Not after last time. 

-BLIP-

**REI** jumped up onto the closest pine tree and released his harness.

+INVERSION+

-BLIP-

Six fiber-optic strands emerged from his back that carried him to the tree tops. *REI* was born with the genetic abilities of *the_spider*. He was agile, and could climb anywhere in any orientation with immense speed, all while not being noticed.

-BLIP-

**REI** emerged on the top of the tallest tree in the pine grove.

> *things don't seem to have changed much since last time...*

He looked at the two moons in the sky. They were almost overlapping.

> *Not good. Looks like an eclipse is about to begin.*

It started to rain. He peered over to his right and saw **the_flash**. Time was ticking, and **CHI** would be fine without him... at least for now 

-BLIP-
