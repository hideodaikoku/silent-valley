In the desolate **void** of **the_spiral**, at its lowest rung, lay an **inverted helix**. The chasm was so deep that even the sound of dust hitting the ground echoed endlessly. But that day, from the ground, a faint glowing light emerged. It grew steadily brighter until it filled the space.  

The light coalesced into the figure of a small child, curled in a fetal position. **the_child**, completely naked, had long, straight white hair. She raised her head, bewildered.  

> "This is new," she thought. "Everything feels new."  
> "Who am I?"  
> > "Where am I?"  
> > > "What year is it?"  

She couldn't tell. A faint whisper echoed in her mind. One whisper became two, then three. The whispers grew louder.  

```
> yield("CHI");
```  

And then, silence.  

She remembered. Or perhaps, that was all she could remember.  

She was **Chi**. A faint echo of her animal past surfaced—a hunt, a cage. It all felt like a distant blur. The last clear memory was a footprint in the mud. But what came after?  

**Chi** looked around, disoriented. It was dark. Cold. She flexed her fingers, wiggled her toes, and felt the smooth, icy concrete beneath her feet. She shivered. She needed something to wear.  

```
> shroud();
```  

And then, warmth.  

---

> "Ooh, that feels good," she thought.  

```
> move();
```  

**Chi** noticed a window above her. Her body moved on its own, as if an invisible force guided her. One leg lifted, then the other.  

She felt a heavy pull, an unseen hand pulling at her, arching her back and propelling her torso into a somersault.

She found herself on a ledge.

> "This is so strange!" Chi exclaimed, alarmed.  
> "How is this happening? More importantly, who is doing this?"  

The ledge was glowing at her feet. She could now make out the stone rectangular shape of the ledge. It was a soft staircase.

She glanced behind her. Nothing.

She glanced ahead. Another ledge. And above that, the glowing silhouette of yet another ledge.

Taking one deep breath, **Chi** reached out and leapt. Suddenly, the ledge began to move again. She slipped, scrambled, slid down and fell with a *thud*.

> "Ouch! ... Gotta be careful..."

**Chi** got up and dusted herself.

> "Not so bad."

```
> believe();
```

She climbed on with all her might and crawled on top of the first ledge, slowly lifting her body up again. This time the ledge moved counter-clockwise. But **Chi** knew what to do. She jumped up and pirouetted into the thin air. Up and away! On to the next ledge.

> Oof!

She slammed head first onto the third ledge. It hurt. But she did it. She made it to the next ledge without falling.

> Hop. Skip. Turn and jump. That's it. I got it.

And like that, **Chi** found her way from one ledge to another. One step at a time to the top of the first set of stairs of **the_spiral**.

So like that, one step at a time, **Chi** climbed.

The climb seemed to have taken her several hours, or was it a few days? Who could tell. But if she didn't stop, she would fall. She knew that for certain.

> Gasping for air, nearly out of breath, Chi asked the voice, "What time is it?"

```
"..."
```

> "Where am I?"

```
> "the_abyss"
```

> Okay... but where do I need to go?

```
> "down"
```

> What? You mean jump back down? But I just came here all this way!

```
> plunge();
```

And with that, the whole universe was sucked into **Chi**'s mind. Everything started to come back. **the_hunt**, **the_lilac_altar**, **moonlight_lake**, the **great_battle**, and then **the_flood**.

> +shift+
>> +unshift+
>>> +transform+

**Chi** began to fall. But she fell upwards, to the ceiling in an odd contortion.

<hr/>

<br/>

**Chi** appeared in a red room. A red room with red curtains and a black and white checkerboard floor and a single hanging light from above. In the center of the room was an old-fashioned device.

The device had 9 buttons and a small digital screen on top with a round receptacle receiver.

```
> dial('16-42-24');
```

**Chi** did as she was told. She pressed the numbers on the keypad. 

+click+, +click+
+click+, +click+
+click+, +click+ 

+CLACK+

Three doors appeared. Each door had an inscription on it. She had no idea what it meant.

<div style="text-align: center;">

| door 1 | door 2 | door 3 |
|  ---  |  ---  |  ---  |
|  +++  |  ===   |  ---   |

</div>

```
> choose();
```

It was hard to tell which one to pick. **Chi** looked back again. And all she saw was darkness.

The dark void seemed to be getting closer. She squinted. The whispers in her head seemed to get louder. Fear. Panic. Paranoia. It all seemed to spiral in.

Her heart began to beat louder. Louder. LOUDER. LOUDER. EVERYTHING WAS SO LOUD.

The darkness reached its hands out and grasped her by her leg.

**Chi** fell, wriggling free.

> "Off!" Off with it!

Now she knew what she had to do. She jumped and charged head first to the door on the right.

And then there was light.
