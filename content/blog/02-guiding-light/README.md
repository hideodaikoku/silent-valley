**chi** was outside. there wasn't much she could see in the forest. it was still very dark. and very quiet. it was so quiet that she could hear her own heartbeat. her footsteps seemed to make no sound either. 

the opening behind her closed. no knob, no slit, not a sign one could use to enter again.

> ok, now what?

```
> ...
```

> well?

```
> ...
```

**chi** looked around frantically in the mist. she could see shrubs, the outlines of trees and mountains in the distance. there really wasn't much more she could see ahead of the mist but it felt like she was being watched.

**chi** began walking forward. looking desperately for sings of life - anything. her heart was still beating from the chase and paranoia of the climb. strangely enough though, she didn't feel tired.

```
> init(probe)
```

**chi** snapped her fingers. a tiny orb of light appeared. it grew to about the size of an apple. and remained floating in the air.

**the_probe** moved forward slowly. and as it floated, **chi** could see the mist clearing away. the plants of **silent_valley** began to rise and reach out to it. color seemed to return to the peonies, and the hydrangeas twisted in delight. the vines cleared away and opened up in a passage like form.

and as **the_probe** grew, the pine grove began to bend. the trees gave way and twisted left to right, parting ways like drawn curtains to an open tunnel.

the **the_probe** stopped. it remained floating there, as if beckoning **chi** to follow it. 

> i guess i have no choice then, huh?

**chi** followed the orb. the forest floor felt damp and cool. the vines seemed to be alive now. moving away as **chi** stepped in. she could hear a gentle singing now. it was like an angel's voice. what was it singing?

> i can hear it now! the golden eggs? the shepherd?.... and what if i don't?

the singing stopped.

+CRACK+


lightning and thunder. it began to rain. it began to rain heavily. **chi** looked at the ground. the water began to rise. the trees began to close in, forest walls began to narrow


||flood||


+crack+

in a flash. everything went back to normal.

> **chi** shuddered. why me?

silence.

> i guess i'll have to find a way around.

**chi** snapped her fingers. **the_probe** came back towards her. it hurled itself forward again.

> i'm getting the hang of this.

the forest began to clear again. but it was getting late, and chi began to tire. she had to find a rest spot.

> okay, it's time to find shelter...

in the distance she saw what looked like a white run-down door.

> must be the right direction

```

<hr/>

in the distance, **the_figure** re-appeared. though a slit in space.

he peered down at the path from the treetops. 

> "good. she figured out how to use the probe."

and slipped out of sight as he watched **chi** walk towards **millet_lab**. 

> "five clicks until the hunters find her. if only i could warn her."

he sighed

> ***+touch+***

rainfall. and a warning.

> "that should do it"

he looked again at his wrist, and saw the circuits beginning to fade. 

> not much time left for me either.

six beats.

+click+

**the_figure** vanished again.
