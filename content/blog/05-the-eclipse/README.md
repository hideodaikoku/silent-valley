**Rei** looked up at the night sky as he made his way through the treetops. The rain was getting heavier, and he could see the water level rise before him. It wasn't the flood that he was afraid of, but what followed that was disturbing. The moons were converging, and the eclipse was nearly on its way. 

Down below he could see the animals begin to move up to safer ground. Many of them were used to **the_flood**. Some had developed specialized shelters to wait out the rain, others had adapted their bodies physically to stay submerged for the entire duration of the flood.

**Rei** had no choice but to stay mobile. Because he knew that if he was found, he would be **hunted**. 

+SLICE+

A spear of light grazed his shoulder. **Rei** flinched.

> "Enemy territory ... not at a time like this"

He looked around. A rain of arrows started hurling at him from below. One of **the_children** had spotted him.

He whipped out a harness knife and switched course.

-BLIP-

Another **light_spear** hurled near his head

-FWOOM-

**Rei** whipped out his harpoon, but hesitated.

> "Best not to engage. To engage is to instigate a war"


He dropped down to ground level and touched the floor.

-BLINK-

Three drops appeared on the floor. He drew a reaction pattern and a line in the sand.

--

A shadow clone appeared up in the sky. 

-BLINK-

> "hm.. that should keep them busy"

The spears hurled at the shadow clone. **Rei** moved ahead.

+THWACK+

A massive axe came crashing down and sliced the entire tree grove in half.

> "okay they aren't falling for that"

Arrows, axes, spears came from all directions.

> "something is different this time for sure"

And then, it happened.

+SCHICK+

A massive spear impaled **Rei** in his place. 

Straight through the heart. With one last effort he tried to free himself, but it was too late.

His circuits began to flicker and his body began to disintegrate.

The sky began to darken. The water was rising. The moon had vanished.

It was the eclipse. 

**+BLINK+**

the sky opened its third eye.

**+BLINK+**

+PANDEMONIUM+

**+BLINK+**

The sky turned a deep crimson.

**+BLINK+**

The flood gates were open.
