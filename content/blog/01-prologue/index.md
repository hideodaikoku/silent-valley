In the waking hours of the hour of the fowl, the forest floor of **silent_valley** was quiet, in the third season of **the_hunt**. 

The forest was shrouded in mist; one could barely see past the serpentine vines of the thicket. A deep tone, dark and beckoning, spoke to the darkness of **silent_valley**. There was no sun, and no light, save for the ocean of despair in the departure of life.

Beyond the bramble of the towering fortresses of the pine grove was **the_spiral** :: a tall concrete receptacle in the shape of a hollowed out ark. **the_spiral** had no doors and no openings, no cracks, and no windows. A large concrete slab with several corridors leading out like long bridges into the mist of higher levels of **silent_valley**. **the_spiral** was free of vines, creepers or moss. It seemed completely out of place amidst the thickness of the jungle. Where did it come from? What purpose did it serve?

The animals worshiped **the_spiral** as an ancient force of nature. Legend said all that approached would wither to ash and aether. Once every two hundred and seventy-six days, a slit of light would emerge, giving way to three beacons of winter light, shooting into the sky. They called this event **the_flash**. It would only last for one week, but it was enough for the animals of **silent_valley** to bask in sunlight and rejoice. Sound and colour would fill the void of **silent_ valley**'s mist. And then the slit would close. 



The animals had all sorts of myths about **the_spiral**. Some of the elders claimed that, **the_spiral** was alive, dormant, waiting to hatch. Every once in a while, the spiders would hear whispers of footsteps emerging to and from the spiral, but no figure could be seen or heard.



Each year, **silent_valley** would commemorate a countdown to **the_flash** with **the_hunt**. As tradition would permit, **the_tiger** of **silent_valley** would be bestowed with the honor of ringing the bell to commemorate the start of **the_flash**. All the animals would gather around: the wolves, monkeys, boars, horses, and snakes.



****the_tiger**** sat at the top of his throne on **the_apex** rock, gnawing at the bones of his youngest cub. A ruthless predator and self-proclaimed king of **silent_valley**. 

**the_tiger** had six eyes, a gargantuan muscular physique, and a iridescent translucent skin adapted for hiding and hunting in plain sight. With a single blink, he could disappear into nothingness and hunt all animals in his vicinity and reappear exactly where he sat without giving his prey a moment to anticipate his next move. One could not look **the_tiger** in the eye . If you did, it was a certain death. **the_tiger** was not the harbinger of fear. **the_tiger** was fear itself.



All the animals of **silent_valley** cowered in his shadow, and in exchange for his mercy, they offered him trinkets of service. Over the years, **the_tiger** had created an empire of sorts - a drug ring he called **the candy factory**. The factory produced a cheap drug-like pill that kept all the animals of **silent_valley** in a cycle of endless addiction and servitude. He sold the candy to neighboring warlords in exchange for **photons**.



**the_tiger** looked at the faint shadow of the moon.

> **+full moon+**, he thought

He sniffed the air for the scent of ashen blood dust. 

> **musty**, he reminisced

Faint, lingering, but it was certainly there. 

The weight of his ancestors knew what that meant.

It was time for **the_hunt** to begin.

**the_tiger** rose up from his seat and growled, blinking one eye at a time. The archers dipped their arrows in fire from the trees and shot. **the_ape** rang the bell of **the_hunt**. The boar squealed and writhed in anticipation from the shackles of his iron cage. The battle drums of **silent_valley** started to turn the forest floor into a ritual ground for sacrifice. And so began the beginning of the hunt.

A hooded figure stood above the puddle of blood from the remains of the boar's carcass. he had pale skin with silver white tattoos running like circuitry around his entire body. he was neither dead nor a live - silken and translucent like ghost of pale circuitry. 

>  **"+scent+"** he thought

**the_figure** stooped down and took a flask of the boar's bones and muttered a hymn of requisition.

**the_figure** wrote down an inscription on the flask and slipped it into his bag of vials. 

with three dots on the forest floor the figure drew a diffusion map. the sand of the forest floor began to shift into a pattern of twisting roots. water seeped into the center of the hole at the base of **the_figure**'s feet. it rose to his knees, and as he looked up, two antlers grew from the base of his head, as he twisted into a seven foot tall shadow of a humanoid elk hybrid. 

His eyes constricted into narrow slits, as his spirit became one with the silence of the forest.

> ***+touch+***

With a hush, he disappeared into a slit in the fabric of the forest. Not a sound or soul could see or hear or perceive where he had been.

all that was left was a silver pool.

> **-vision-**

somewhere in the depths of **the_spiral**, at that very same moment, a faint light emerged in the abyss.
