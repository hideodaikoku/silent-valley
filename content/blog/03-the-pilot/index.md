the singing got louder as she approached what could only be described as a run-down fishing boat. it was rusty, had many holes with paint wearing off the edges.

the air smelt damp, of rum, and she could see several bottles strewn against the floor.

> *who' be that?* 🐦

**Chi** paused. unsure if she should run away or hide

> *come out little birdie. i heard you* 🐦

**Chi** stood frozen in her tracks.

> *i'm going to count to 3.* 🐦

**Chi** looked around frantically for something to defend herself with.

> *1....* 🐦

a pile of twigs in the shape of a bow

> *2....* 🐦

a rock

 > *3 ...* 🐦

**the_probe**!

> *here i come little birdie GWA HA HAH AHA* 🐦

bullets began to fly in violent succession. she could feel the ground shake as the ma**Chi**ne gun emptied its magazine.

DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA-DA\

**Chi** ran for cover and snapped her fingers

> +*oooooooooo* :: **the_probe** zoomed past the thicket in a low hum

**Chi** rolled down into a ball and folded her hands in prayer position. she didn't know why she did it. it just seemed to make sense

> +CLAP+

**the_probe** expanded into the size of a room

> *WHA? WHAT? IT CAN'T BE...* 🐦

the shooting stopped. out from the helm of the ship a large hefty bird in navy blue overalls jumped off.

+THUD+ 
+STOMP+

He had a missing leg, an eye-patch, a crutch and a machine gun on his shoulder.

> *RUFFLE ME FEATHERS IT CAN'T BE,* \
> *WHAT'S IT BEEN? A HUNDRED YEARS?* 🐦

*chi* peered out of the rock she was hiding behind. **the_probe** came back to her behind her.

> "Do.. Do I know you?" she stammered

> *HO HO HO, KNOW ME? YOU MUST BE JOKING!* \
> *TIS I! SAILOR OF THE FLOOD_LANDS! THE PILOT OF SAND!* \
> *NO_RAIN!* 🐦

> "No_rain" ? "Have we met before?"

> "YOU REALLY DON'T REMEMBER DO YOU?" 🐦
> Hic. 🐦
> WELL. NO TIME TO WASTE. THE FIRST FLOOD IS ABOUT TO START. 🐦

Chi hesitated. But she looked down at her feet. Indeed, the water was beginning to rise. It was now down to her knees. She mustered her courage and climbed towards the boat. The boat rocked and creaked as she set foot on it.

The boat was incredibly large and seemed to float above the air. It had a hundred different buttons, glowing dimly in a repeating pattern. 

She watched as No_rain climbed into the captain's seat, setting his crutch against what seemed like the skeleton of a member of his crew.

> "DON'T MIND ERNIE, HE'S HARMLESS. HO HO HO HO" 🐦

**Chi** looked around for a place to sit.

> "STRAP IN SPIRIT. YOU'RE IN FOR A RIDE" 🐦

The boat rocked and shook violently. The engines revved up, making a deafening noise.

ÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖ

> TAKE OFF! AHAHAHAHAHAHAH 🐦

the boat soared through the water into the darkness ahead.

> safe for now...

But for some reason, **chi** felt the worst wa yet to come.
