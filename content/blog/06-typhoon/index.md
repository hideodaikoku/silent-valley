# approaching storm

Back on the boat, **Chi** was still shivering from shock. Her mind was full of questions.

> Who am I? Why don't I remember anything? Where am I?

One by one, **the_pilot** replied with guttural laughter between sips of pale ale and bad singing.

> HO HO HO! FOR THE LAST TIME, I CAN'T TELL YOU, **spirit**! YOU HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT EACH TIME 🐦

> I AM JUST THE PILOT. I AM TO TRANSPORT THE LIVING ACROSS THE FLOOD. FOR A FEE OF COURSE. AFTER YOU GET OFF, I'LL BE TAKING SOME PHOTONS HO HO HO! 🐦

**Chi** felt scared. At least **the_pilot** didn't want to harm her. 

She looked out the window. The rain was starting to get heavier and the winds started to get stronger.

+WHOOSH+

A gale rocked **the_hemingway** to and fro. **Chi** felt her stomach turn.

**the_pilot** had warned her to not look into the sky, for doing so was bad luck.

But **chi** could not resist.

The moons had vanished a day ago. She thought she might have imagined it, but almost seemed as if a large eye appeared in the sky and opened its eyes momentarily.

Right at when the eclipse had happened, she felt an intense pain in her chest. It was as if a part of her had died. She had never felt a pain that intense.

When she looked at her chest, she could see that indeed, there was a clean hole in her chest. She could put her hand and see it emerge from the other side.

Something was calling to her.

+CRACK+

Thunder and lightning. Right ahead was an approaching storm. 

> BUCKLE UP **spirit**, THIS PART'S GOING TO BE FUN! HO HO HO. 🐦

> that's usually a bad thing, **chi** muttered to herself.

+CRACK+

**the_pilot** revved up the engine as **the_hemingway** went to full throttle. The rusty parts started to rattle. A pipe burst somewhere but **the_pilot** didn't seem to care.

+ZOOOOM+

Full speed ahead. The vessel disappeared into the storm.

-BLIP-


**the_hemingway** emerged on the other side of the storm.
